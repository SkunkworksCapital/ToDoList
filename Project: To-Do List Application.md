Project: To-Do List Application

This project is a web-based to-do list application hosted using cPanel on a personal blog. It provides an easy-to-use interface for managing tasks, allowing users to add, display, and delete tasks in real time. The design and interactions are responsive, ensuring seamless usage across various devices.
