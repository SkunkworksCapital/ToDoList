# ToDoList
This project is a simple web-based to-do list application. It allows users to add, display, and delete tasks in a list. The project is built using HTML, JavaScript, and PHP (for backend task handling). Bootstrap is integrated to style the UI elements.

**Features**:
Task Management: Users can add tasks through an input field, which then sends a request to the backend to store the task.
Task Deletion: Each task can be deleted using a dedicated button that sends a request to remove the task from the server.
AJAX Integration: Tasks are dynamically added and deleted without refreshing the page, thanks to AJAX requests managed by JavaScript.
Responsive Design: The interface uses Bootstrap to ensure a user-friendly and responsive design across devices.
****Technical** **Stack**:
****Frontend**: HTML5, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript
**Backend**: PHP (todo.php for task handling)
**JavaScript**: Manages AJAX requests for adding, deleting, and displaying tasks.

This project provides a simple, efficient interface for managing tasks with smooth, dynamic interactions.
